===========
This repository refers to build tools that help us manage our sites.

Description
-------------
**connectionmonitoringtool**: it's used to monitor sites connection.
When we create a website we need to be sure the website is operative.
We can use a browser and type the url website,
this way wastes a lot of time.
We need a different way to verify our website is operative, a more efficient way.
Then we propose a tool to monitor our sites connections.
This tool can send us an email notification about how our website connection is gone
or it can present a report.
